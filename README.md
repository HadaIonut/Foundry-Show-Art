This module is a modified version of Zeel's [Show Art](https://github.com/zeel01/TokenHUDArtButton) module.

It offers a button to the token or tile HUD that opens the actor's token, or their artwork on right click. 
The displayed window contains an input field for crediting the author of the art with the option to lock the field. 
It also adds shortcuts keybindings:
 - Shift+Z: Show token to everyone
 - Shift+X: Show artwork to everyone
 - Shift+V: Open token for yourself
 - Shift+B: Open artwork for yourself
